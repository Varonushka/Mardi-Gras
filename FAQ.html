                <div class="tab-content">
                    There is no need for tickets to see a parade...all of them are FREE!! That is why it is called
                    "The Greatest Free Show
                    on Earth!". You only get tickets if you want to sit down on stands as the parades pass.

                <div class="tab-content">
                    Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6 (see
                    question below) and ends on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash
                    Wednesday
                    when Lent begins. It is also common for people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and,
                    for
                    clarity, to call Fat Tuesday "Mardi Gras Day." Locals tend to call the season "Carnival" and, to
                    us,
                    the last two weekends leading up to Tuesday are"Mardi Gras."

                    Twelfth Night (aka, the Feast of the Epiphany and Three Kings' Day) is January 6th and is the
                    official start of Mardi Gras every year. While the date of Fat Tuesday changes, Twelfth Night
                    does
                    not.

                <div class="tab-content">
                    The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They
                    began the tradition of presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the
                    krewe
                    and their guests.

                    they come from?</label>
                <div class="tab-content">
                    Rex, the King of Carnival, selected the Mardi Gras colors and assigned meaning to them in 1892.
                    Purple stands for justice, green for faith, and gold for power.

                <label class="tab-label" for="chck6">Why are masks worn?</label>
                <div class="tab-content">
                    By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for everyone else,
                    and the elaborate masks that some wear add to the fun.

                <div class="tab-content">
                    The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random drawings, while
                    others invite a celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by the School
                    of Design, who sponsors the Rex parade. His identity is revealed the day before the parade.

                <div class="tab-content">
                    The tradition of float riders throwing trinkets to the crowds began in the 1870s, and continues
                    today. Typical throws include beads, cups, doubloons and stuffed animals.

                    Economic impact reports indicate that Mardi Gras generates over $1 billion in annual spending.

                <div class="tab-content">
                    City governments are not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades. The governments issue parade
                    permits, but that is the extent of their involvement. Krewes independently schedule and coordinate
                    their own parades.

                <div class="tab-content">
                    Mardi Gras parade krewes are private, non-profit organizations whose members get together year round
                    to plan their parade's theme, costumes and unique throws. Each Carnival Club, as they are known, is
                    individually funded by its members. They support their krewe through dues, sales of krewe-related
                    merchandise to their members, and fundraising. Mardi Gras parade krewes sometimes have corporate
                    sponsors.

                    The city of New Orleans is not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades; their only involvement
                    is to issue parade permits to each individual Mardi Gras krewe that schedules and coordinates its
                    own parade.

                    MardiGrasNewOrleans.com, of course. We organized and presented the first live Mardi Gras in 1995 and
                    continued sharing this with our visitors for several years with companies like Microsoft and REAL
                    Media. The live events showcased on MardiGrasNewOrleans.com have been covered by the New York Times,
                    Chicago Tribune, TImes PIcayune, Morning Advocate, San Diego Union Tribune, Texas Monthly, and the
                    Discovery Channel among others.

                    The first year, we presented the Orpheuscapade, and soon offered live chats with celebrities,
                    interviews with costumed revelers on the streets, and video from atop hotels in the Garden District.

                <img src="./Gallery/a1.jpg" alt="March" class="imagez">
                <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                    Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before
                    Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major
                    parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most
                    elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many
                    events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some
                    of them masquerade balls).</p>
                <br>
                <h3><u>Traditional Colors</u></h3>
                <p>The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold, and purple. The
                    colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
                    inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is
                    unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially
                    selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism</p>
                <br>
                <p>Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a
                    theory that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic
                    tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple
                    was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national
                    flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that
                    order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be
                    placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.

                <h3><u>Throws</u></h3>
                <p>A 'throw' is the collective term used for the objects that are thrown from floats to
                    parade-goers.
                    Until the 1960s, the most common form was multi-colored strings of glass beads made in
                    Czechoslovakia.

                    Glass beads were supplanted by less expensive and more durable plastic beads, first from
                    Hong Kong,
                    then from Taiwan, and more recently from China. Lower-cost beads and toys allow
                    float-riders to
                    purchase greater quantities, and throws have become more numerous and common.</p>
